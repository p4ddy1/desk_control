# Desk Control

Application to control a height adjustable desk via Bluetooth LE like the Ikea IDÃ…SEN. 
It should also work with every desk that can be controlled with the LINAK Desk Control App.
You can store positions and move the desk to these positions.
The application can minimize to tray, and you can recall the positions from there.
Works on macOS, Linux and Windows.
